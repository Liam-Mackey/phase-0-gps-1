#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The main concepts that I was struggling with had to do with pushing files to github. I was having trouble transferring files from my local computer to the remote repository. After some practice though and by helping Gai I like to think that I have solidifies in my head how to push files from my local computer onto github.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The process of adding committing and pushing files was solidified for me during the GPS. I also learned a lot from Bison and he showed me a few cool shortcuts that allow me to upload files into github and to use shell more efficiently. Another thing that was effectively molded into my head during the GPS was the process of fixing merge conflicts. The merge conflict during the GPS was the second one I encountered. The first time it took me a while and a couple of google searches to figure out what was wrong. But this time Gai and I solved it on the first try.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I felt pretty good in that the only questions I asked had to do with assumptions I had that i just wanted to confirm. I definitely asked Gai a few questions just to make sure he knew what we were doing and I also asked Bison questions about how to screen share and questions about the challenge.

#What still confuses you about git?
Not so much about gt but I still have issues using relative locations to link images in MD files. Bison had to go, so Gai and I had a hard time linking the image to the md file. We tried but failed. I am still having issues using MD.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My experience was Unique my partner did not have access to the challenge so I had to walk him through it. It was confusing at times but overall I believe that I have a good grasp on git and i believe that i showed that during this GPS. It was very fun!
